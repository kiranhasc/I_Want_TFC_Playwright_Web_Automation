/**
 * Keeps the machine awake for as long as a test run is in flight.
 *
 * Why this is needed: a Playwright run generates no keyboard or mouse input,
 * and Windows' idle timers do not count background CPU work as activity. On a
 * default Balanced power plan the machine therefore sleeps mid-run (observed
 * here: "Sleep after" was 180 seconds on AC). Sleep suspends the whole
 * process tree — the runner, its workers, and Chrome — so the run does not
 * merely slow down, it stops dead and no further test events arrive. Node's
 * timers are suspended too, so even Playwright's own per-test timeout never
 * fires; the run just hangs until someone wakes the machine.
 *
 * The fix is a scoped, temporary power request rather than editing the user's
 * power plan: the same mechanism media players and installers use. It is held
 * only while a run is active and released as soon as the queue drains, so
 * normal idle behaviour resumes the moment testing finishes.
 *
 * The display is kept on as well, not just the system. Runs here are headed
 * (`--headed`, because headless traffic gets blocked by the CDN's bot
 * detection), and letting the display sleep invites Chrome's occlusion
 * handling to throttle rendering in the browser under test — plus the display
 * timeout is what triggers the idle lock screen in the first place.
