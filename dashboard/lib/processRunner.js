 * `npx` on Windows spawns playwright as a child, which in turn spawns
 * worker + browser processes, so in principle `taskkill /T` walking the
 * tree from the `npx` wrapper's PID should reach all of them. In practice,
 * Chrome's main process frequently re-parents itself on Windows (observed:
 * a launched chrome.exe's ParentProcessId no longer pointed at anything in
 * our spawned tree by the time we queried it), so it silently survives
 * `taskkill /T` and keeps running. Since dashboard jobs run strictly one at
 * a time (see RunManager._runJobQueue), any chrome.exe that appeared after
 * this job started and is still alive after the tree-kill is safe to
 * assume belongs to this job — sweep and kill those directly by PID,
 * without touching chrome.exe processes that predate the job (e.g. the
 * user's own separate browsing session).

 * — it costs a few seconds up front in exchange for an accurate total for
 * the entire run instead of one that only fills in as modules start.
